# Hexagonal Architecture Guideline

As we know, hexagonal architecture centers on **a clean separation** between _business logic_ and _infrastructure_, achieved through traits (ports) and their implementations (adapters), making the system modular, testable, and maintainable.

## The key components

### **1. Domain (Application Core)**

- This is the heart of an application, containing all business rules, domain models, and logic.
- The domain is completely independent of external technologies and frameworks, ensuring that business logic does not depend on infrastructure details.

### **2. Ports**

- **Ports** are interfaces (for e.g. in Rust, typically defined as traits) that specify how the domain interacts with the outside world.
- There are two main types:
  - **Incoming Ports**: Define how external actors (like APIs, CLI, or services) can interact with the domain (e.g., use cases, commands, queries).
  - **Outgoing Ports**: Define how the domain depends on external resources (e.g., repositories, external services).

### **3. Adapters**

- **Adapters** are concrete implementations of the ports, translating between the domain and external systems.
- **Incoming Adapters**: Implement incoming ports, handling inputs from the outside (for e.g., HTTP handlers, CLI interfaces).
- **Outgoing Adapters**: Implement outgoing ports, connecting to databases, messaging systems, or other services.

### **4. Dependency Encapsulation**

- All third-party dependencies (like databases, frameworks, or external APIs) are encapsulated within adapters.
- The domain layer never directly interacts with these dependencies, promoting testability and flexibility.

### **5. Error Handling**

- Domain-specific error types are defined and propagated through ports, ensuring that all error scenarios are handled explicitly and safely.

## Example

Let's take an example on Rust (we should follow the same rules for Go services).

| Component           | Rust Component        | Responsibility                                   |
|---------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Domain              | Structs, Enums, Logic | Business rules, domain models                    |
| Ports (Traits)      | Traits                | Define contract for interaction                  |
| Adapters            | Structs implementing traits | Connect domain to external systems         |
| Dependency Encapsulation | Adapter modules  | Hide third-party details from the domain         |
| Error Handling      | Custom error types    | Safe, explicit error propagation                 |
